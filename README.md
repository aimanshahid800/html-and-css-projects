Twisting Squares
This project is about creating a visual effect of rotating squares with different colors. The squares are nested within each other and each square rotates continuously, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.

HTML Structure
The HTML structure is made up of nested div elements with the class square. Each div represents a square and is nested within another square. Each square has a unique color class (e.g., red, yellow, orange, etc.) that is used to apply the specific color to the square.

CSS Styling
The CSS styling includes specific styles for the body, container, and squares. The body has a black background and uses flexbox to center the container. The container is positioned absolutely in the center of the body.

Each square is positioned absolutely in the center of its parent square and has a size of 94% of its parent. This creates the effect of squares nested within each other. Each square also has a unique background color.

Animation
The rotation animation is achieved using CSS keyframes. The rotate animation is defined to rotate the element from 0 to 360 degrees. This animation is applied to each square with a duration of 10 seconds and is set to repeat infinitely.

Usage
To see the effect, open the HTML file in a browser. You will see the squares rotating continuously.

Note
This project is for demonstration purposes and does not include any interactive functionality. It is best viewed in a modern browser that supports CSS animations.
